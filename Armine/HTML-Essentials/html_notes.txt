block level elements -- take up their own line within the flow of the document
inline level elements -- appear within the flow of other content

content types:
- metadata — setting up presentation or behavior of the rest of the content (primarily found in head of doc)
- embedded — any content that imports other resources into the doc
- interactive — any content specifically intended for user interaction
- heading — defines header of section; explicitly marked up with sectioning elements or be applied by heading content itself
- phrasing content — text of document; any elements used to mark up text within paragraph level structures
- ...

<pre> </pre>
displays text however you see it within tags

<em> </em> emphasis; italicize; a screen reader would change their vocal inflection
<i> </i> italicize; screen reader won’s change vocal inflection; presentational tag
<strong> </strong> same 
<b> </b> 

headings 1-6
use headings in order, don’t jump from h2 to h5

if you don’t have content inside the paragraph, you don’t need to have an empty paragraph

<br />
self-closing tag

<dl> </dl> definition list that has 2 parts which are <dt> and <dt> </dt> term
<dd> </dd> definition

&nbsp;
non breaking space

html doesn’t use align attribute anymore because CSS handles it now

sectioning elements
<h1>…<h6>
<article>
<aside>
<nav>
<section>

semantic elements
<header>
<main>
<footer>

sectioning element — every time that it’s used within the document outline, a new section is created

main element doesn’t create a section in the outline, but article does

aside element
represents a section of a page that consists of content that’s tangentially related to the content around the aside element, & which could be considered separate from that content; ex: sidebar

div tag — use it as a last resort
use id or class attributes to give semantic meaning
id —> can only use once each
class —> can reuse as many times as you want

- header element
represents introductory content for its nearest ancestor (parent tag sectioning content or sectioning route element);
contains group of introductory or navigational aids;
ex: articles, sections, a sides, etc.
- footer element
represents a footer for it’s nearest ancestor (parent element);
needs information about its section — who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data & the like.
- main element
consists of content that’s directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application;
not a sectioning content;
content must be unique & main content of the page (ex: excludes content that’s repeated across a set of documents such as site navigation links, copyright information, logos, banners, etc.)


WAI-ARIA — Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications

role attribute (helps create accessible sites & applications)

link element is used to request external resources for the page

use anchor element to create a link (not link element)

<a></a> attributes
href — Hypertext reference
target — open a page in a new window or tab, or control where a page opens within a frame set. ex: target = “(_blank, _parent, _self, _top, _framename)”
rel — describes relationship of target object to link object; ex: rel = “(next, alternate, nofollow, author, noreferrer, bookmark, prefetch, download, prev, help, search, license, tag)”
title — helps make links more accessible by giving the link a title, which can be read & interpreted by assistive devices, search engines, or other content readers


GLUT links — redirect users to pages and sites that are external to the current site

<a href="https://www.lynda.com/" title="Visit lynda.com">lynda.com</a>
opens lynda.com in the same tab

<a href="https://www.lynda.com/" title="Visit lynda.com" target="_blank">lynda.com</a>
opens lynda.com in a new tab

<a href="_assets/syntax.zip" title="HTML syntax reference">HTML syntax reference!</a>
browser recognizes zip file but cannot open it within the browser, so it downloads it

<a href="_assets/syntax.pdf” title="HTML syntax reference">HTML syntax reference!</a>
browser recognizes pdf file and is able to open it within the browser, so it does

<a href="_assets/syntax.pdf" title="HTML syntax reference" download>HTML syntax reference!</a>
browser recognizes pdf file and can open it within the browser but is forced to download it

<a href="_assets/syntax.pdf" title="HTML syntax reference" download="HTML_syntax">HTML syntax reference!</a>
downloads syntax.pdf as HTML_syntax.pdf

linking to page regions
- give section an id, for example “one”
- link will be <a href=“#one” title=“section one”>Link to Section 1</a>

<p>Link to <a href="destination.htm#two" title="destination">Section 2</a> of the destination.htm page</p>

CSS — cascading style sheets
comments in html: <!--    comment    -->

inline styles are bad; must change all h2 elements one by one

margin: 0 auto
0 is for top & botton; auto is for left & right

try to display Georgia, if not then Times New Roman, if not then lastly display whatever serif you have available
font-family: Georgia, “Times New Roman”;
system font — font installed on almost every computer when it ships
“” are necessary if the font has more than one name; ex: “Times New Roman”

font-size: 2em;
whatever default font size you have, display 2x that

margin: top right bottom left
margin: 1em 0 .4em
top 1em; right & left 0; bottom .4em
